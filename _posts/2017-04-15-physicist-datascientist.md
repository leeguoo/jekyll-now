If you send a physicist to destroy a target with a mortar, he/she will pull out a pen and a piece of paper to draw a schematic figure showing the shell trajectory:  

claim the relevant physical quantitis:  

>> *g* <= gravitational acceleration value  
>> *v*_0 <= initial velocity of the shell  
>> $\theta$ <= angle between the tube and the ground  
>> *s* <= distance between the mortar and the target  
>> *t* <= flying time of the shell  

and do the following caculations:
>>the flying time of the shell
>>t = 2*v_0*\sin\theta/g  
>>the flying distance of the shell
>>s = v_0*\cos\theta*t = 2*v_0*\sin\theta*\cos\theta/g  

Then, he/she will get an

\$\$t = v\_0\\sin\\theta\$\$
