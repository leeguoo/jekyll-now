title: Data Scientists are Pre-Newton Physicists
---

If you send a physicist to operate a mortar, he/she will pull out a pen and a piece of paper to do following calculations:

```
g <= gravitational acceleration value  
v_0 <= initial velocity of the shell  
\theta <= angle between the tube and the ground  
s <= distance between the mortar and the target  
t <= flying time of the shell  

step1:   

t = 2*v_0*\sin\theta/g  
s = v_0*\cos\theta*t = 2*v_0*\sin\theta*\cos\theta/g  
```
